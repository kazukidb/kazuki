 * Objects should implement LifecycleRegistration so that the container will inject the singleton

 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Foo implements LifecycleRegistration, LifecycleAware {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void register(Lifecycle lifecycle) {
 *         lifecycle.register(this);

 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void eventFired(LifecycleEvent event) {

 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
